# ☁️ Cloud Service Types

Cloud computing offers different service models to meet various business needs. The three primary service types are:

---

## 🧩 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- Users manage operating systems, applications, and data.
- Examples: Azure Virtual Machines, Amazon EC2.

---

## ⚙️ Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- Provides hardware and software tools over the internet.
- Enables developers to build, test, and deploy applications without managing infrastructure.
- Examples: Azure App Service, Google App Engine.

---

## 📦 Software as a Service (SaaS)

- Delivers fully functional software applications over the internet.
- Users access software via web browsers without worrying about infrastructure.
- Examples: Microsoft 365, Salesforce.
