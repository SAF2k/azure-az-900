## üíª Compute Services

- **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs):**  
  Flexible, on-demand computing resources in the cloud. You can run Windows or Linux VMs tailored to your needs.

- **Azure App Service:**  
  Managed platform to build, deploy, and scale web apps and APIs quickly without managing infrastructure.

- **Azure Functions:**  
  Serverless compute allowing you to run event-driven code without provisioning servers.

- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):**  
  Managed Kubernetes container orchestration for deploying and managing containerized applications.

## üåê Networking Services

- **Virtual Network (VNet):**  
  Provides isolated, secure networking in the cloud. VNets allow you to segment and control traffic.

- **Azure Load Balancer:**  
  Distributes inbound traffic to multiple VMs to ensure availability and reliability.

- **Azure Application Gateway:**  
  A web traffic load balancer with advanced routing and security features.

- **VPN Gateway:**  
  Enables secure cross-premises connectivity between your on-premises networks and Azure.

- **Azure ExpressRoute:**  
  Dedicated private connection between your datacenter and Azure for higher bandwidth and lower latency.
