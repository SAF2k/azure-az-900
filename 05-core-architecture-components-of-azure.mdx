# 🏗️ Core Architecture Components of Azure

Microsoft Azure is built on a robust architecture composed of several key components. Understanding these helps you design and deploy solutions effectively.

---

## 🌐 Azure Regions

- Geographically distributed data centers.
- Each region contains multiple availability zones for high availability.
- Allows deploying resources close to users for lower latency.

---

## 🏢 Availability Zones

- Physically separate locations within a region.
- Designed to protect applications from data center failures.
- Provide redundancy and resiliency.

---

## 🌍 Resource Groups

- Logical containers that hold related Azure resources.
- Facilitate management, deployment, and access control.
- Resources within a group share the same lifecycle.

---

## 🧩 Subscriptions

- Billing entities that group resources and services.
- Provide boundaries for resource allocation and access.
- Can have multiple subscriptions for organization or project separation.

---

## 🔐 Azure Active Directory (AAD)

- Central identity and access management service.
- Enables secure authentication and authorization.
- Supports single sign-on (SSO), multifactor authentication (MFA), and role-based access control (RBAC).
