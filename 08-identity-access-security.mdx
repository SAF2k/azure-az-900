# 🔐 Identity, Access, and Security in Azure

Security is a core pillar of Azure, and understanding how identity and access management works is essential.

---

## 🧑‍💼 Identity Management

- **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):**  
  Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. It manages users, groups, and devices.

- **Single Sign-On (SSO):**  
  Enables users to access multiple applications with one login, enhancing security and user experience.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  
  Adds an extra layer of protection requiring users to verify their identity with multiple methods.

---

## 🛡️ Access Control

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
  Grants permissions based on user roles to manage Azure resources securely.

- **Conditional Access:**  
  Policies that control how and when users can access resources based on device, location, and risk.

---

## 🔍 Security Features

- **Azure Security Center:**  
  Provides unified security management and advanced threat protection.

- **Azure Key Vault:**  
  Safeguards cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications.

## ✍️ My Learning Reflection

Diving into Azure’s identity and security services emphasized how security integrates deeply into every layer of the cloud environment. RBAC and Conditional Access provide powerful ways to keep resources safe.
